Sg Woocommerce Checkout Location Picker helps customers to mark their geo location on google map in woocommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

The Checkout Location Picker for WooCommerce allows customers to mark their geographical location on a Google map directly within the WooCommerce checkout page.This checkout map integration tool is known as the Geolocation Picker for WooCommerce plugin, also referred to as the "Address to Map Picker," "WooCommerce Checkout Map," or "Checkout Map Picker" plugin.  

**What is Geocoding?**

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses, such as ("1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA," into geographic coordinates, like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739). These coordinates are utilized to mark locations on a map or adjust its position. The checkout location picker plugin operates on geocoding principles. Hence, it is also recognized as the Geolocation Picker for WooCommerce.

**How does the checkout location picker for woocommerce work?**

This WooCommerce location picker plugin is compatible with your WordPress CMS. It displays a Google map on the billing and shipping address sections, allowing customers to pinpoint their precise location during checkout, ensuring easy delivery access for WooCommerce stores. The map marker serves as a validation tool for the user-entered address.

**How does it benefit?**

Checkout location picker for WooCommerce plugin confirms the location using maps from the customer end itself. This will help the vendors to deliver the products without any further calls correctly or asking for directions. This delivery location map picker can save time ensuring easy delivery access for WooCommerce store owners and increase customer satisfaction.

**NOTE**

The existing version of the woocommerce checkout location picker plugin currently lacks support for the WooCommerce Blocked checkout feature. Users are advised to have a standard checkout page with the [woocommerce_checkout] shortcode to utilize the plugin effectively. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we strive to enhance the location picker plugin’s functionality to better suit your needs.
